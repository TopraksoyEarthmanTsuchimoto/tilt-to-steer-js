# tilt-to-steer-js
### Turn your tablet or phone into a steering wheel!
This library converts raw deviceorientation data (mobile device tilt in degrees) into usable good numbers.

- NOTE: This library does not feature a *perfect-in-theory* kind of solution to the gimbal lock problem. It only gives you numbers that will hopefully be **good enough**  to steer a car in a racing game that would run in any screen orientation.
